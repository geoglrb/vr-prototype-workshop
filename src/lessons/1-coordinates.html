      Exercise: Now that you've been taught about how Aframe uses a right-handed
      coordinate system (ie. negative z-index values move things away from you)
      try putting the traffic lights in the correct order:
      red at the top
      yellow in the middle
      green at the bottom

      The red light has been correctly positioned for you. Try to do this
      directly with the code, as well as with Aframe inspector.

      Note: see how there are "glitches" happening with the red light?
      This is called "z fighting". You have two objects at the exact same
      distance from the camera, so the engine isn't sure which one to put
      in front. See if you can figure out a solution to this problem.
